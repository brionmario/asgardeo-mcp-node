## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to provide a standardized way for applications to convey contextual
information relevant to authorization decisions. These SDKs facilitate the integration of MCP with Asgardeo in Node.js
applications.

- **MCP Express (@asgardeo/mcp-express)**: Middleware specifically tailored for Express.js applications to seamlessly
  integrate MCP-based authorization.
- **MCP Node (@asgardeo/mcp-node)**: Core functionalities and utilities for MCP, which can be used in various Node.js
  environments. The Express middleware may utilize or depend on this core package.

For detailed installation and usage instructions for each package, please refer to the README file within its respective
directory (e.g., `packages/mcp-express/README.md`).
